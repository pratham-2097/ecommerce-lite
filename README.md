This project is a tiny MySQL-backed E-commerce (Lite) demo with a short Python walkthrough: the SQL lives in sql/ecommerce_lite.sql, which creates the tables (Customer, CreditCard, Product, Staff, Purchase with PK/FK/UNIQUE constraints), seeds a small dataset (3 customers, 1 staff, 7 products, a few cards, 8 purchases), and is meant to be run once to stand up the schema. The Python side (e.g., app/main.py) uses a simple CLI to connect to MySQL, list products, add or update a product as staff, attach a credit card to a customer (we store only last4), and make a purchase that checks two rules—product must be active and there must be enough inventory—then records qty, captures unit_price_at_purchase, decrements inventory_qty, and shows the derived total (qty × unit_price_at_purchase) in output. For reporting, the script runs a graded multi-table join (customer name, product name, qty, total, purchased_at where unit_price_at_purchase > 75) and a small helper for low-stock items (inventory_qty < 5) so you can demonstrate staff awareness. In short: the SQL file builds and seeds the database; the Python CLI proves the core flows (add card → purchase → inventory drops, invalid purchases blocked) and runs the required report—everything you need for a clean, fast video demo.
